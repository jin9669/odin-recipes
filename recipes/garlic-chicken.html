    <p>This actually uses my breading for Chicken Fried Steak---my husband 
    suggested we try it with chicken breasts, and it was delicious!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="Ingredients">

        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

    <div class="Steps">
    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge in the dry ingredients until evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li>Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve.

    </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Editors Note</h2>
    <div class="note"> We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.
